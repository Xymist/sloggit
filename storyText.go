var introductionText = "You wake up in a clearing in the forest, resting on a thick carpet of pine needles. You stand up and look about you, your hand instinctively reaching for your Rusty Sword and Battered Shield. There is a chill in the air; from that and the trees you deduce that you must be many hundreds of miles further North than where you laid down to sleep. Suspecting foul play, you check that you are undamaged and set off through the trees...\n\n"

var clearingText = "You are standing in a quiet clearing. The impression of a sleeping body has been left in the soft forest floor.\n"

//Set off North
var startNorthText = "The forest gets denser as you walk, the trees seeming to press in around you. You might be imaginging it, but it feels like everything is becoming just a little bit quieter..."

//Set off West
var startWestText = "You walk through the trees until you find yourself facing a river. It's far too fast to ford; you could follow it and look for a crossing, but you might do better to go back to the clearing.\n"
