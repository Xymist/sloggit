//Introduction to the game
var introductionText = "You wake up in a clearing in the forest, resting on a thick carpet of pine needles. You stand up and look about you, your hand instinctively reaching for your Rusty Sword and Battered Shield. There is a chill in the air; from that and the trees you deduce that you must be many hundreds of miles further North than where you laid down to sleep. Suspecting foul play, you check that you are undamaged and set off through the trees...\n\n"

//Starting location
var clearingText = "You are standing in a quiet clearing. The impression of a sleeping body has been left in the soft forest floor.\n"

//Set off North
var startNorthText = "The forest gets denser as you travel, the trees seeming to press in around you. You might be imaginging it, but it feels like everything is becoming just a little bit quieter...\n"

//Set off East
var startEastText = "After a few short minutes of walking, you see a break in the trees. Hurrying towards it you encounter a fence, bordering a narrow, rutted dirt road. You could vault the fence for an easier path, but you don't know whose road this might be.\n"

//Set off South
var startSouthText = "Thinking of home, you strike South, determined to walk all the way back to civilisation if necessary.\n"

//Set off West
var startWestText = "You walk through the trees until you find yourself facing a river. It's far too fast and deep to ford; you could follow it and look for a crossing, but you might do better to go back to the clearing.\n"

//Follow the river upstream
var upRiverText = "You make your way along the riverbank, heading roughly North according to the sun. After several hours it begins to get dark, but you're yet to find a crossing. You start looking for shelter in the surrounding landscape, and shortly come across a cave. Wilderness caves are risky, but it could represent safety.\n"

//Follow the river downstream
var downRiverText = "This path is steep and rocky, and after some time you begin to hear a faint rumble in the distance, which becomes a muffled roar as you continue to follow the river. Presently you find yourself standing at the side of a waterfall as the river cascades over a tall cliff, the ground beneath obscured by cloud and spray.\n"

//Leap off the cliff!
var cliffJumpText = "Well, that was pretty daft, wasn't it?\n"

//Duck into the cave
var caveEntranceText = "It is cool and dark in here, though the floor is dry dirt. The sounds from outside are muffled. You wish for a torch, but through the gloom you spy a banded chest against the wall.\n"

//Look for a good tree to climb
var treeClimbText = ""

//Keep heading North
var farNorthText = ""

var caveExitText = ""

var caveDepthsText = ""

//Open the chest
var caveChestText = "You approach the chest, and see that although it is heavily banded the lock has rusted almost through. You could probably break it open."

//Head towards the shadows
var dungeonEntranceText = "As you approach the dark smear it turns out to be a small stone archway embedded in the hillside. Everything else around you looks untouched by human hand; this doesn't belong here...\n"

var portalFallText = "You take a deep breath, and let yourself fall towards the swirling energies beneath you. There is a flash of light, and you are knocked unconscious.\n"
